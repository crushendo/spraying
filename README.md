Spray card analysis via image processing with python/openCV

This project is intended to allow us at the DUDA farm to maximize our chemical spraying efficiency. This project uses python and OpenCV to analyze water sensitive paper cards which change color from bright yellow to blue when contacting water. These cards will be set up in the field during spraying and then collected and scanned. We will analyze these cards using computer vision to calculate the percent coverage area and droplet size distribution or various chemicals, spray equiptment/techniques, at different positions/areas in the field, etc.

The ability to precisely calculate the coverage area and droplet size distribution will allow us to run field trials testing different variables. We will then be able to identify how to maximize our efficiency, potentially saving on materials and minimizing our chemical inputs.
